## Course Description

## Learning Objectives

Each module in this course has it's own specific learning objectives. You can find them at the top of each module overview page (accessible from the *Modules* menu item on the course website). 

## Readings

- Do we want to keep the book subdirectory, or just the learning modules page? 

## Research Software

- Update for R, etc.

We will use Python and other open source software in this course. You can find details on installing and setting up your research software [here](software.qmd). Note that Module 2 is focused on installing, setting up, and getting started with the required software.
