Welcome to the course website for FCIT 607: Data, Methods, and Models for Future Cities! This couse is a graduate-level introduction to reproducible research, modelling, and quantitative data analysis with an emphasis on causal, probabilistic, and futures thinking. It's part of the [Master of Future Cities (MFC)](https://uwaterloo.ca/environment/graduate/future-graduate-students/programs/master-future-cities?utm_source=envgradgoogleads&utm_medium=cpc&utm_id=4119&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAxOauBhCaARIsAEbUSQSj4EocKfVTTNc6pCwICYJRndRkEXXvTElfnG4gFBuPJLaQ8T-0eu8aApMzEALw_wcB) program offered by the [Faculty of Environment](https://uwaterloo.ca/environment/) at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca). You can access all course materials on this site [for free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources), including the course syllabus, overviews of each learning module, lecture slides, and an open access textbook (*currently in draft form*).
